## Imports and Initialization

- `Flask`, `jsonify`, `request`, `Response`, `render_template`, `redirect`, `url_for`, and `flash` are imported from `flask`.
- `MongoClient` is imported from `pymongo` to interact with MongoDB.
- `datetime` and `json` are standard Python libraries.
- `ObjectId` is imported from `bson` to handle MongoDB ObjectIds.
- `LoginManager`, `UserMixin`, `login_user`, `login_required`, and `logout_user` are imported from `flask_login` for user authentication.
- The Flask app is initialized, and a MongoDB client is created to connect to a local MongoDB instance.

## Error Handling

- A custom 404 error handler is defined to render a `404.html` template.

## Routes

### Authentication

- `/login`: Handles user login.
- `/logout`: Logs out the user.

#### ðŸ“Œ Note: Admin Credentials
- For now, the admin credentials are hardcoded:

- `/articles_by_coverage/<coverage>`: Returns articles by a specific coverage class.
- `/popular_keywords_last_<int:x>_days`: Returns the top 10 keywords used in the last `x` days.
- `/articles_by_month/<year>/<month>`: Returns the count of articles published in a specific month.
- `/articles_by_word_count_range/<int:min>/<int:max>`: Returns articles with word counts within a specified range.
- `/articles_with_specific_keyword_count/<int:count>`: Returns articles with a specific number of keywords.
- `/articles_by_specific_date/<date>`: Returns articles published on a specific date.
- `/articles_containing_text/<text>`: Returns articles containing specific text in their description.
- `/articles_with_more_than/<int:word_count>`: Returns articles with more than a specified number of words.
- `/articles_grouped_by_coverage`: Groups articles by coverage classes.
- `/articles_last_<int:x>_hours`: Returns articles published in the last `x` hours.
- `/articles_by_title_length`: Groups articles by the length of their titles.

- `/most_negative_sentiment`: Returns the 50 articles with the most negative sentiment.

## Utility Functions

- `convert_objectid_to_str`: Converts MongoDB ObjectId fields to strings for JSON serialization.

## Main Execution

- The Flask app runs in debug mode if the script is executed directly.

This application provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for querying and analyzing articles stored in a MongoDB database, with a focus on various attributes such as keywords, authors, dates, word counts, languages, and sentiment analysis.

## app_analyze.py

`app_analyze.py` is a Python script designed to analyze text documents stored in a MongoDB collection. It performs sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER) on the text data and updates the documents with the analysis results.

### Features

- Connects to a MongoDB database and retrieves documents.
- Uses Stanza for tokenization and named entity recognition (NER) in Arabic.
- Uses NLTK's VADER for sentiment analysis.
- Processes documents concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor.
- Updates MongoDB documents with sentiment and entity data.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- MongoDB
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
    - `Flask==3.0.3`
    - `pymongo==4.8.0`
    - `stanza==1.8.2`
    - `nltk==3.9.1`
    - `ftfy==6.2.3`
    - `flask_login==0.6.2`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sayedalimohamad/task04.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible at `mongodb://localhost:27017/`.

### Usage

1. Ensure the required NLTK data is downloaded:

    ```sh
    python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python advanced_data_analysis.py
    ```

### Configuration

MongoDB connection details are hardcoded in the script. Modify the connection string if your MongoDB instance is running on a different host or port.

### Functions

- `ensure_model_downloaded(lang_code)`: Ensures that the Stanza model for the specified language is downloaded.
- `safe_decode(text)`: Safely decodes text using ftfy to fix any encoding issues.
- `process_document(document, idx)`: Processes a single document:
    - Decodes the text.
    - Performs sentiment analysis.
    - Performs named entity recognition (NER).
    - Updates the document in MongoDB with the analysis results.
- `analyze_texts()`: Fetches documents from MongoDB and processes them concurrently.

### Logging

Errors and important events are logged using Python's logging module.

### Example Output

The script prints the results of the analysis to the console.

## A `000_Notice.md` is in the directory of data, and should be reads.

``` The JSON database backup is divided into 28 chunk files of 1000 each. Use 'mergeJSONfile.py' to rejoin them and `data_storage.py` to connect to MongoDB. Be sure to review the restrictions in the `000_Notice.md` file located in the data directory. ```
